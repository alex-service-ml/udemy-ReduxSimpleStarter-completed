# ReduxSimpleStarter, Completed
The result of working through the first two sections of the [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/) udemy course. In spite of the name, redux is *not* yet used (component-level state, instead).  

Original, incomplete project can be found [here](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter.git). All credit goes to Stephen Grider for his awesome introduction to React.

### Getting Started

Perform the following to get up and running:

```
> git clone https://github.com/slash-fury/udemy-ReduxSimpleStarter-completed.git
> cd ReduxSimpleStarter
> npm install
> npm start
```

**Note:** In order to perform searches with the Youtube API, you'll need to generate an API key with Google. You can do so [here](http://console.developers.google.com/). Once you have generated a key, simply replace the value of *API_KEY* in `src/index.js`.
